# Cancer Data Analysis

- In This particular project we are having cancer data where we first pre-process the data, since it may contain some irregularities and noise.
- Then we build machine learning model to make clusters based on different features like quality radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, area_mean, smoothness_mean, compactness_mean, concavity_mean.
