# Titanic Survival Analysis

- In this particular project we are having titanic survival dataset where first we pre-process the data, since it may contain some irregularities and noise.
- Then we build machine learning model that can predict survived passengers based on different features like passengerid, survived, pclass, sex, age etc.
