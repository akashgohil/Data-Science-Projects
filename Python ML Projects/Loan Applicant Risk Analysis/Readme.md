# Loan Applicant Risk Analysis

- In this particular project we are having Loan applicant dataset where first we pre-process the data, since it may contain some irregularities and noise.
- Then we build machine learning model that can predict loan applicant's risk if the person complete the loan or not based on different features like Age, Total Work Experience, number of years in city, cost to request ratio etc
