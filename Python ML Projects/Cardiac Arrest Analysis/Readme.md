# Cardiac Arrest Analysis

- In This particular project we are using cardiac arrest data where we first pre-process the data, since it may contain some irregularities and noise.
- Then we build machine learning model to make clusters based on different features like Gender, Chain_smoker, HighBP, Obese, Diabetes, Metabolic_Syndrome, Consumes_other_tobacco_products etc.
