# Red Wine Quality Analysis

- In this particular project we are having red wine dataset where first we pre-process the data, since it may contain some irregularities and noise.
- Then we build machine learning model that can predict quality of red wine based on different features like quality category, citric acid quantity, chlorides density etc.
