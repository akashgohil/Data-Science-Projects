# Hypothesis Automation Project

- In this project I have automated the process of hypothesis testing.
- As we know hypothesis testing is used to check that their is any significant relationship between the columns or not.
- So here you just have to provide two columns and it will find out which test will be suitable for the given column and it will apply that test and give output that their is any significant relation between the columns or not.
